Build a simple app that lists the top 100 movies in a list. Based on the raw json available in this repo using the base:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericthelin/movieJson/[commit_id]/
The list of top movies is available in the file "top_movies.json" in this repo.

For example:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericthelin/movieJson/a38606f10d253b08b766679d496f42c42bd23a71/top_movies.json

The list should show the poster, summary info and when clicking on the row should open a details screen.

The details for each movie are available under that base using the patterns: [base]/by_id/[imdbId].json
For example:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericthelin/movieJson/a38606f10d253b08b766679d496f42c42bd23a71/by_id/tt0035575.json

Use whatever architecture or libraries you choose.
